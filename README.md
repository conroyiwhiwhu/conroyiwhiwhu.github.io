## Note: If you fork or re-use this project, please make sure you:

    Replace the Google Analytics tracking code with your own, or
    If you don't use Google Analytics, comment the block of code out entirely.
    Edit _includes/disqus.html and either
    Replace the disqus_shortname with your own DISQUS username, or
    If you don't want commenting, remove or comment out the block of code entirely.
    Otherwise I will receive GA data and DISQUS comments from your website.
